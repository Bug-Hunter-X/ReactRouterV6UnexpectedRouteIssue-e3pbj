# React Router v6 Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with unexpected routing behavior in React Router v6.  Navigating to the `/contact` route exhibits unusual behavior, potentially due to conflicts with other routes or component rendering issues.  The solution involves carefully reviewing route definitions, nested route configurations, and potential component lifecycle conflicts.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
